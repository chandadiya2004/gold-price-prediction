# 🌟 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the **Gold Price (GLD)** based on other financial indicators such as SPX (S&P 500), Oil Price, Silver Price, and USD Index. The model has been deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
